      <h2>A Phishing Awareness Platform</h2>
      <span class="tagline">Learn the signs. Trust your clicks.</span>
      <p>Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous cyber threats — and it often works by tricking people, not systems. From fake login pages to urgent emails, these scams are getting harder to spot.</p>
      <p><strong>Hooked?</strong> is designed to raise awareness through interactive learning, real-world resources, and gamified challenges. By understanding the signs of phishing, users become more confident and better prepared to protect themselves and their organisation.</p>
